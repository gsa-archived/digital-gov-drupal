    # The host may have to change, depending on your local. For example, in
    # WSL2, I had ot replace this with my WSL2 instances IP since Drupal is
    # running inside a Docker Lando container, so localhost is the container
    # not WSL2, where Hugo is. This shouldn't matter if this is a remote host.
    # Another host to try is host.docker.internal or find your local machine's
