      value: '<h2 id="start-with-what-s-there">Start with what’s there</h2><p>Where to start is one of the hardest questions to answer when researching a problem. Depending on the type of project, you’ll need to look into a variety of research types to learn what’s been done before. Understanding past research will help you to focus on where you can do new research, and how best to frame that research.</p><p>This process is known as benchmarking. Essentially, it means doing traditional desk-based research to find out what others have discovered in the field you’re investigating. You should also look for research that supports, or does not support, items that you might already know, or think you know, about the subject.</p><p>This process both informs and gives direction to your work. If you know where others have been, you can build off of their work, and contribute to the overall knowledge in this topic through your original research.</p><ul><li><strong>Academic Research</strong> can help you uncover what people have already done in your topic area. Use search engines like Google Scholar or Academia.edu, and publications like the Harvard Business Review, the Stanford Social Innovation Review, and the MIT Technology Review to find projects related to your subject. Read the abstracts of articles that sound interesting, then check those papers’ bibliographies to find additional articles and works.</li><li><strong>Statistical Research</strong> can help you properly frame your area of interest. For example, historical statistics will allow you to understand whether your problem frame should widen out or focus in. Always evaluate the source of your data to maintain data hygiene and fidelity.<ul><li><em>Data hygiene</em> refers to the quality of the data collection and interpretation.</li><li><em>Data fidelity</em> refers to the precision with which the data has been recorded. If the data collection or interpretation is illogical or messy, move on and find better data on which to base your work.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Internal-to-Organization Research</strong> is helpful if your project relates to a program or set of programs already underway in your organization. Look at those programs to see what’s already being done. Talk to the program leaders, review their documents, and, if possible, observe them working in the field. This process will help you frame your approach to avoid duplication of work, and increase your contribution to work already in process.</li><li><strong>External-to-Organization Research</strong> means seeking out and studying existing programs outside of your organization. Look across all sectors: private, non-profit, academic, or other government organizations. Learning what others are developing will help you frame your project in a way that builds on this work. As you notify others of your work, you will also contribute to the community of knowledge on your subject.</li></ul><h2 id="organize-your-research">Organize your research</h2><p>Always properly cite and document desk research sources. Follow the examples below; either print them, or take a screenshot and mark them up digitally.</p><p>Keep all your citations organized and together. Keeping track of research sources means you can quickly and easily find content that you would like to reference or cite in a final report or communication.</p>'
